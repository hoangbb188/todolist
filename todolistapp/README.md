This application is a to-do list that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. 
Tasks can be organized by projects, and each task can have its own details section to store important information about it. 
Users can label tasks by priority using different colors, and sort tasks by date in ascending or descending order. The application also allows users to delete projects and edit their names.
In addition to regular projects, there are two special projects for sorting today and this week's tasks.

In future development, AI could be implemented to help users sort tasks more efficiently, and estimated time of completion could be added to tasks for better time management. A login feature could also be added to enable users to save their tasks and access them from multiple devices.
